# Eye-Exercise

<img src="oneeye.png" width='300'/>

This program consists of 3 simple HTML/CSS/Javascript files that work together; the eyes on screen tracks your mouse movements and then redraws itself based on your position, which simulates the feeling that those eyes are following your every move.

How to run:
1) Download the files.
2) Double click the index.html file and make sure that it's running on a web browser.
3) Move your mouse on-screen.

Roadmap:
1) Potentially add a 3rd Eye that opens up after a certain period of time
